Based on the detected stack, find the best MCP servers for each tool category.

## FIRST: Check already-installed MCP servers

Before searching for anything, check what's already in .mcp.json. Many tools are already covered:

**Known MCP server coverage:**
- `github-mcp-server` → GitHub (issues, PRs, code search, actions, repos) — read + write
- `workiq` → Microsoft 365 (SharePoint, Outlook, OneDrive, Teams, Calendar) — **read-only** (search, query, retrieve). If write access is needed (create pages, send emails, update items), suggest an additional M365/Graph MCP server
- `playwright` → Browser automation, testing, screenshots — read + write
- `atlassian-mcp-server` → Jira, Confluence — read + write
- `datadog-mcp-server` → Monitoring, logs, metrics — read-only
- `azure-mcp-server` → Azure resources, deployments — read + write

When an existing server covers a category in read-only mode, ask the user: "workiq already lets you search SharePoint docs. Do you also need to create/edit content there?" If yes, search for a write-capable MCP server too.

## Discovery Chain (for tools NOT already covered)

### 1. GitHub / Official MCP Catalog
- Search GitHub: `topic:mcp-server` + the vendor/tool name
- Check github.com/modelcontextprotocol/servers for official listings
- These get the 🐙 badge

### 2. Organization Catalog
- Try to read `{org}/.github/mcp-catalog.json` using `get_file_contents`
- If it exists, prefer org-approved servers and respect the blocked list
- These get the 🏢 badge

### 3. Vendor Documentation
- Use `web_search` to find: "{tool name} MCP server official"
- Use `web_fetch` to read install instructions from vendor docs
- These get the 🔰 badge

### 4. Community
- Other GitHub results
- These get the 👥 badge

## Categories to cover

For each category, use `ask_user` with **multi-select** (checkboxes, not radio buttons) so users can pick multiple tools. Always include an "Other (specify)" freeform option.

Example schema for ask_user:
```json
{
  "properties": {
    "tools": {
      "type": "array",
      "title": "Which monitoring tools does your team use?",
      "items": { "type": "string", "enum": ["Datadog", "Grafana", "App Insights", "PagerDuty", "None"] }
    },
    "other": {
      "type": "string",
      "title": "Other (specify)",
      "description": "Any tools not listed above"
    }
  }
}
```

Categories:
- Source control
- Project management (Jira, Linear, GitHub Issues, Azure Boards)
- CI/CD
- Cloud platform
- Monitoring / observability
- Documentation / wiki (SharePoint → workiq, Confluence → atlassian-mcp-server)
- Security scanning
- Communication (Teams → workiq, Slack → slack-mcp-server)

**Important**: When the user selects a service like SharePoint, Teams, Outlook, OneDrive — check if `workiq` is already installed. If so, it already covers that service. Same logic for all multi-service MCP servers.

For each confirmed tool, present the best match with its trust badge and whether it's already installed.

Then output: `<!--phase:2:complete-->`
